# 🌍🌊 EcoWizard.AI-X  
### Open-Source, Real-Time Flood Risk & Construction Feasibility Intelligence Platform  

> **EcoWizard.AI-X** is an open-source, Geo-AI powered decision-support platform that predicts real-time flood risk and evaluates construction feasibility using LiDAR, satellite imagery, weather data, and machine learning — visualized through interactive 2D & 3D web maps, without relying on proprietary GIS software.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

EcoWizard.AI-X is a **web-based, end-to-end automated Geo-AI system** designed to support **urban planning, disaster management, infrastructure development, and climate resilience** through data-driven insights.

By integrating **LiDAR elevation models, satellite imagery, ISRO/Bhuvan datasets, real-time weather APIs, and AI models**, the platform enables stakeholders to:

- Predict flood risk at any geographic location  
- Assess whether construction is **safe, risky, or unsafe**  
- Visualize flood impact in **interactive 2D and immersive 3D maps**  
- Trigger **automated alerts and warnings**  
- Understand *why* a location is risky through **AI-based explainability**

All components are built using **100% free and open-source technologies**, making the system scalable, transparent, and cost-effective.

## ❗ Problem Statement  

Flooding combined with unplanned or unsafe construction is a major cause of:

- 🌧️ Severe infrastructure damage  
- ⚠️ Loss of human life  
- 🏗️ Illegal or high-risk construction practices  
- 🚨 Ineffective disaster preparedness and response  

### Limitations of Existing Solutions  

- Reliance on **static flood maps**  
- Lack of **real-time predictive capabilities**  
- Construction feasibility **not integrated** with flood analysis  
- Heavy dependence on **expensive, license-based GIS platforms**

👉 **EcoWizard.AI-X unifies flood intelligence and construction safety into a single, real-time, open platform.**
