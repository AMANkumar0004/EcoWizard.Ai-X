# 🌊🏗️ AI.X

### Open-Source, Real-Time Flood & Construction Feasibility Prediction Platform

> **AI.X** is a fully open-source Geo-AI platform that predicts real-time flood risk and evaluates construction feasibility using LiDAR, satellite imagery, weather data, and AI — all visualized through interactive 2D & 3D web maps, without relying on paid GIS software.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

AI.X is a **web-based, end-to-end automated Geo-AI system** designed to make **urban planning, disaster management, and construction safety** data-driven and intelligent.

Using **LiDAR terrain data, satellite imagery, ISRO/Bhuvan datasets, real-time weather APIs, and AI models**, AI.X can:

* Predict flood risk for any location
* Decide whether construction is **safe or unsafe**
* Visualize flood impact in **2D & 3D**
* Generate **automatic alerts**
* Explain *why* a location is risky using AI-based reasoning

All of this is built using **100% free & open-source technologies**.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Flooding and unplanned construction have become major causes of:

* 🌧️ Heavy infrastructure damage
* ⚠️ Loss of human life
* 🏗️ Illegal or unsafe construction
* 🚨 Poor disaster preparedness

### Limitations of Existing Systems

* Mostly **static flood maps**
* No **real-time prediction**
* Construction safety **not integrated** with flood analysis
* Heavy dependency on **expensive, license-based GIS software**

👉 **AI.X solves all of these in one unified intelligent platform.**

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution – AI.X

AI.X acts as a **single decision-making system** that provides:

* 🌊 **Real-time flood risk prediction**
* 🏗️ **Construction feasibility analysis**
* 🧊 **2D & 3D live geospatial visualization**
* 🚨 **Automatic alerts & warnings**
* 🧠 **AI-based explanations**
* 🔓 **Completely open-source stack**
